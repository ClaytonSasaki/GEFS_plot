# GEFS_plot

Creates graphics to aid in decision-support and risk communication using the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) system. 

The GEFS is a weather forecast model created by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) that generates multiple forecasts (ensemble members) to address uncertainties in weather observations and model limitations. 

### Data/Dependencies
The .yml lists the package dependencies. Note that these scripts rely on the amazing Herbie python package to pull the GEFS data.
